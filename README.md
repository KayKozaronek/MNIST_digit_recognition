# MNIST_digit_recognition

## Status 
The project is ongoing and an analysis containing Neural Networks will be added.

## What does it do?
This project analyzes the classic MNIST dataset containing 64*64 grayscale images of numbers.
By implementing Linear Regression, SVM, Multinomial Softmax Regression, PCA, Gaussian RBF Kernel 

## What is it? 
This project includes working implementations of the following algorithms from scratch:
- Linear Regression (Gradient based and Closed Form Solution)
- Support Vector Machine (One vs Rest, C SVM, Multiclass)
- Multinomial Softmax Regression and Gradient Descent
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Kernel Methods (Polynomial, Gaussian RBF)

## What technologies are used? 
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Matplotlib
- Sklearn
- Python
  
## What is the ambition of the project? 

The sole purpose of this project was to get a better understanding of the foundational math behind these algorithms and exercise building them from scratch.

## How to run the code?  
running `main.py` in the `part1` folder will run the algorithms on a dataset and report the following: 
- Linear Regression test_error
- SVM one vs. rest test_error:
- Multiclass SVM test_error:
- Softmax test error:
- Softmax test error mod3:
- Test error PCA 18 Components:
- Test error PCA 10 Components:
